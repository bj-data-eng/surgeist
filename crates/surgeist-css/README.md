# surgeist-css

`surgeist-css` is a Rust library for Surgeist consumers that need typed authored
CSS with browser-style recovery and structured diagnostics. It parses
stylesheets and style attributes while preserving valid siblings around malformed
or unsupported input. The current surface includes partial and recognized
unsupported productions; consult the [support reference](docs/reference.md#conformance-sources-and-atomic-records)
for exact boundaries. Cascade, substitution, matching, resource loading, and
layout belong to downstream consumers.

## Start

```rust
use surgeist_css::{CssRecoveryAction, parse_sheet};

let report = parse_sheet(
    ".before { color: red; } @unknown value; .after { color: blue; }",
);
assert_eq!(report.syntax().rules().len(), 2);
assert_eq!(report.diagnostics().len(), 1);
assert_eq!(report.diagnostics()[0].action(), CssRecoveryAction::DropAtRule);
```

The two style rules survive, and the unknown at-rule produces one diagnostic.
See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for local setup and verification.
