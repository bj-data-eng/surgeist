# surgeist-css

`surgeist-css` is a Rust library for Surgeist consumers that need typed authored
CSS with browser-style recovery and structured diagnostics. It parses
stylesheets and style attributes while preserving valid siblings around malformed
or unsupported input. The current surface includes partial and recognized
unsupported productions; consult the [support reference](docs/reference.md#conformance-sources-and-atomic-records)
for exact boundaries. Cascade, substitution, matching, resource loading, and
layout belong to downstream consumers.

Checked `CssBackgroundLayer` and `CssBackground` construction retains authored
omissions and enforces size/position and final-color constraints. Intrinsic
`background` expansion supplies all eight longhands with per-layer schema
initials. Its bounded specified serializer composes canonical children under
one cumulative resource policy, preserving symbolic values and counting omitted
authored nodes without charging discarded output bytes.

Checked `CssBorderImage` construction retains its five optional components and
requires a slice before width or outset. Intrinsic expansion supplies the five
ordered longhands from authored values or schema initials. Bounded specified
serialization compresses all four stored edges, preserves numeric branches and
symbolic calculations, and counts every child even when its initial is omitted.

Checked `CssShadow` construction requires blur before spread; `CssBoxShadowList`
is nonempty. Box shadows retain signed offsets and spread, optional nonnegative
blur, optional color, and inset. `CssDropShadow` instead retains an optional
nonnegative standard deviation and cannot contain inset or spread. Lengths form
one contiguous grammar group. Box-shadow supplies a noninherited terminal
contribution with `none` initial. Bounded specified serializers on all four
shadow models preserve authored omissions, explicit zero and currentcolor,
list order, exact numeric literals, and symbolic math and colors.

## Start

```rust
use surgeist_css::{CssRecoveryAction, parse_sheet};

let report = parse_sheet(
    ".before { color: red; } @unknown value; .after { color: blue; }",
);
assert_eq!(report.syntax().rules().len(), 2);
assert_eq!(report.diagnostics().len(), 1);
assert_eq!(report.diagnostics()[0].action(), CssRecoveryAction::DropAtRule);
```

The two style rules survive, and the unknown at-rule produces one diagnostic.
See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for local setup and verification.
