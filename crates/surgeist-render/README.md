# surgeist-render

A Rust library for Surgeist integrators who need GPU rendering of scenes onto
headless or presented surfaces. It owns scene validation, GPU execution, surface
resources, explicit headless readback, and render diagnostics.

The current implementation is GPU-only, with direct Vello and WGPU graph routes.
It requires a compatible GPU; browser execution and application/window lifecycle
belong to the integrating host. The current style-facing exports and intended
crate boundary are described in the [architecture guide](docs/explanation.md).

## Start

From this checkout, run the focused render-and-readback test:

```sh
CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true cargo test -p surgeist-render --lib tests::surface::headless_render_can_be_read_back -- --exact
```

Expect one passing test: it renders a 4 × 4 scene on the GPU and reads back
64 RGBA bytes. See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for prerequisites
and the full first-success walkthrough.
