# surgeist-runtime

Rust orchestration contracts for Surgeist application and adapter authors.
Runtime coordinates application state, events/effects, surface lifecycle,
invalidation and queued inputs. It emits abstract work intents and owns its
adapters to lower-level contracts, including the bounded native DOM task loop.
Concrete task execution, rendering and OS window event loops belong to their
respective owners.

The [DOM orchestration guide](docs/explanation.md#dom-orchestration) explains
`DomSession`, Source operations, event/task custody and hosted lifecycle limits.
These native operations do not supply complete browser services, positive focus
movement or rendering readiness.
The actual Style association owner also retains [Document stylesheet-set
preferences](docs/explanation.md#document-stylesheet-set-preferences), including
empty-list history and source-defined enable/select behavior. `DomSession::new`
returns the original DOM intact with `PendingParsedAssociations` when parsed
association history remains pending under canonical custody. No current public
Session mutation front installs a parsed report after bootstrap. Retaining that
history does not establish a Style processing service or association readiness.

## Start

From a prepared checkout with the [prerequisites](docs/getting-started.md#prerequisites),
prove that a reducer's task request becomes a runtime intent:

```sh
cargo test --offline --locked -j 1 -p surgeist-runtime --lib tests::runtime_forwards_task_work_as_intents_without_executing_it -- --exact
```

Expected: one passing test checking a forwarded task intent and no diagnostics.
[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) explains the source and result.
